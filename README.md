Focused on Basic Ui, with better feature delivery, A ChatGpt like Applicatio, currently only supports text inputs, have added audio feature to be converted to text before sending to LLM. The new feaures
is we can choose while creating a session if we want to add AI to that Session or we simply want that session to keep personal messages.

Please look into CHAT_AI.pdf for a visual support. thanks.
