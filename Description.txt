This project is a **full stack automated code generation platform** developed with a modern technology stack, including **Python (FastAPI) for the backend** and **React for the frontend**. The platform is designed to streamline and automate the process of writing, testing, and debugging code, catering to developers and teams looking to accelerate their workflows and reduce human error.

### Key Features

- **Automated Code Generation:**  
  Utilizes Python-powered backends to generate code snippets, boilerplate templates, or entire module structures based on user input or specifications.

- **Voice-Powered Assistance for input :**  
  Features a voice-transcription module (built with FastAPI and React) enabling developers to dictate code or commands, which the system then transcribes and interprets, making the platform more accessible.

- **Real-time Collaboration and Persistent Chat:**  
  Includes a chat component where users can interact with the assistant, share code snippets, ask questions, and retain conversation historyâ€”improving collaboration and user support.

- **Modern, User-Friendly Frontend:**  
  The UI is built with React, providing a responsive, interactive, and intuitive user experience.

- **Scalable Backend Architecture:**  
  Employs FastAPI to ensure high performance, scalability, and easy integration with additional AI-powered modules.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React  
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) 
- **AI & Automation:** Python modules for code generation, debugging, and speech recognition  
- **Dev Tools:** Integrated chat support 
- **Collaboration:** Persistent conversation history and real-time user feedback

### Intended Use Cases

- Auto-generating code for new projects or repeated patterns
- Debugging and linting existing codebases with AI suggestions
- Speech-to-text for hands-free code entry or commands
- Team collaboration with persistent chat and code sharing
